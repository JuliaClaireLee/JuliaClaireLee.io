This is America's day. This is democracy's day. A day of history . hope, of renewal . resolve. Through a crucible for . ages, America has been tested a new . America has risen to . challenge.Today we celebrate . triumph not of a cidate but of a cause, a cause of democracy. . people . will of . people has been heard, . . will of . people has been heeded.We've learnt, again, that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile. ., at this hour my friends, democracy has prevailed. So now on this hallowed ground, where just a few days ago, violence sought to shake . Capitol's very foundations, we come togetherther as one nation under God indivisible to carry out . peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries. As we look ahead in our uniquely American way, restless, bold, optimistic . set our sights on a nation we know we can be . must be, I thank my predecessors of both parties. I thank .m from . bottom of my heart. . I know . resilience of our Constitution . . strength, . strength of our nation, as does President Carter, who I spoke with last night who cannot be with us today, but who we salute for his lifetime of service. I've just taken a sacred oath each of those patriots have taken. . oath, first sworn by George Washington. But . American story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us. On we . people who seek a more perfect union. This is a great nation, we are good people . over . centuries through storm . strife in peace . in war we've come so far. But we still have far to go. We'll press forward with speed . urgency for we have much to do in this winter of peril . significant possibility. Much to do, much to heal, much to restore, much to build . much to gain.Few people in our nation's history have been more challenged or found a time more challenging or difficult than . time we're in now.A once in a century virus that silently stalks . country has taken as many lives in one year as in all of World War Two.Millions of jobs have been lost. Hundreds of thous.s of businesses closed. A cry for racial justice, some 400 years in . making, moves us. . dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer. A cry for survival comes from . planet itself, a cry that can't be any more desperate or any more clear now. . rise of political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism, that we must confront . we will defeat. To overcome .se challenges, to restore . soul . secure . future of America, requires so much more than words. It requires . most elusive of all things in a democracy unity. Unity.
In another January on New Year's Day in 1863 Abraham Lincoln signed . Emancipation Proclamation. When he put pen to paper . president said . I quote, 'if my name ever goes down in history, it'll be for this act, . my whole soul is in it'. My whole soul is in it today, on this January day. My whole soul is in this. Bringing America together.r, uniting our people, uniting our nation. . I ask every American to join me in this cause. Uniting to fight . foes we face anger, resentment . hatred. Extremism, lawlessness, violence, disease, joblessness, . hopelessness. With unity, we can do great things, important things. We can right wrongs, we can put people to work in good jobs, we can teach our children in safe schools. We can overcome . deadly virus, we can rebuild work, we can rebuild . middle class . make work secure, we can secure racial justice . we can make America once again . leading force for good in . world. I know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy .se days. I know . forces that divide us are deep . .y are real. But I also know .y are not new. Our history has been a constant struggle between . American ideal, that we are all created equal, . . harsh ugly reality that racism, nativism . fear have torn us apart. . battle is perennial . victory is never secure. Through civil war, . Great Depression, World War, 9/11, through struggle, sacrifice, . setback, our better angels have always prevailed. In each of our moments, enough of us have come together.r to carry all of us forward . we can do that now. History, faith . reason show . way. . way of unity. We can see each o.r not as adversaries but as neighbours. We can treat each o.r with dignity . respect. We can join forces, stop . shouting . lower . temperature. For without unity .re is no peace, only bitterness . fury, no progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos. This is our historic moment of crisis . challenge. . unity is . path forward. . we must meet this moment as . United States of America. If we do that, I guarantee we will not fail. We have never, ever, ever, ever failed in America when we've acted together.r. . so today at this time in this place, let's start afresh, all of us. Let's begin to listen to one another again, hear one another, see one another. Show respect to one another. Politics doesn't have to be a raging fire destroying everything in its path.
Every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war . we must reject . culture in which facts .mselves are manipulated . even manufactured. My fellow Americans, we have to be different than this. We have to be better than this . I believe America is so much better than this. Just look around. Here we st. in . shadow of . Capitol dome. As mentioned earlier, completed in . shadow of . Civil War. When . union itself was literally hanging in . balance. We endure, we prevail. Here we st., looking out on . great Mall, where Dr King spoke of his dream. Here we st., where 108 years ago at another inaugural, thous.s of protesters tried to block brave women marching for . right to vote. . today we mark . swearing in of . first woman elected to national office, Vice President Kamala Harris. Don't tell me things cannot change. Here we st. where heroes who gave . last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace. . here we st. just days after a riotous mob thought .y could use violence to silence . will of . people, to stop . work of our democracy, to drive us from this sacred ground. It did not happen, it will never happen, not today, not tomorrow, not ever. Not ever. To all those who supported our campaign, I'm humbled by . faith you placed in us. To all those who did not support us, let me say this. Hear us out as we move forward. Take a measure of me . my heart. If you still disagree, so be it. That's democracy, that's America. . right to dissent peacefully. . . guardrail of our democracy is perhaps our nation's greatest strength. If you hear me clearly, disagreement must not lead to disunion. . I pledge this to you. I will be a President for all Americans. All Americans. . I promise you I will fight for those who did not support me as for those who did.Many centuries ago, St Augustine  . saint of my church  wrote that a people was a multitude defined by . common objects of .ir love. Defined by . common objects of .ir love. What are . common objects we as Americans love, that define us as Americans? I think we know. Opportunity, security, liberty, dignity, respect, honour, . yes, . truth. Recent weeks . months have taught us a painful lesson. .re is truth . .re are lies. Lies told for power . for profit. . each of us has a duty . a responsibility as citizens as Americans . especially as leaders. Leaders who are pledged to honour our Constitution to protect our nation. To defend . truth . defeat . lies. Look, I underst. that many of my fellow Americans view . future with fear . trepidation. I underst. .y worry about .ir jobs. I underst. like my dad, .y lay in bed at night staring at . ceiling thinking: 'Can I keep my healthcare? Can I pay my mortgage?' Thinking about .ir families, about what comes next. I promise you, I get it. But . answer's not to turn inward. To retreat into competing factions. Distrusting those who don't look like you, or worship . way you do, who don't get .ir news from . same source as you do. We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts, if we show a little tolerance . humility, . if we're willing to st. in . o.r person's shoes, as my mom would say. Just for a moment, st. in .ir shoes. Because here's . thing about life. .re's no accounting for what fate will deal you. Some days you need a h.. .re are o.r days when we're called to lend a h.. That's how it has to be, that's what we do for one another. . if we are that way our country will be stronger, more prosperous, more ready for . future. . we can still disagree.My fellow Americans, in . work ahead of us we're going to need each o.r. We need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter. We're entering what may be . darkest . deadliest period of . virus. We must set aside politics . finally face this p.emic as one nation, one nation. . I promise this, as . Bible says, 'Weeping may endure for a night, joy cometh in . morning'. We will get through this together.r. together.r. Look, folks, all my colleagues I serve with in . House . . Senate up here, we all underst. . world is watching. Watching all of us today. So here's my message to those beyond our borders. America has been tested . we've come out stronger for it. We will repair our alliances, . engage with . world once again. Not to meet yesterday's challenges but today's . tomorrow's challenges. . we'll lead not merely by . example of our power but . power of our example. Fellow Americans, moms, dads, sons, daughters, friends, neighbours . coworkers. We will honour .m by becoming . people . . nation we can . should be. So I ask you, let's say a silent prayer for those who lost .ir lives, those left behind . for our country. Amen. Folks, it's a time of testing. We face an attack on our democracy, . on truth, a raging virus, a stinging inequity, systemic racism, a climate in crisis, America's role in . world. Any one of .se would be enough to challenge us in profound ways. But . fact is we face .m all at once, presenting this nation with one of . greatest responsibilities we've had. Now we're going to be tested. Are we going to step up? It's time for boldness for .re is so much to do. . this is certain, I promise you. We will be judged, you . I, by how we resolve .se cascading crises of our era. We will rise to . occasion. Will we master this rare . difficult hour? Will we meet our obligations . pass along a new . better world to our children? I believe we must . I'm sure you do as well. I believe we will, . when we do, we'll write . next great chapter in . history of . United States of America. . American story. A story that might sound like a song that means a lot to me, it's called American An.m. . .re's one verse that st.s out at least for me . it goes like this '. work . prayers of centuries have brought us to this day, which shall be our legacy, what will our children say? Let me know in my heart when my days are through, America, America, I gave my best to you.' Let us add our own work . prayers to . unfolding story of our great nation. If we do this, .n when our days are through, our children . our children's children will say of us: '.y gave .ir best, .y did .ir duty, .y healed a broken l..' My fellow Americans I close . day where I began, with a sacred oath. Before God . all of you, I give you my word. I will always level with you. I will defend . Constitution, I'll defend our democracy. I'll defend America . I will give all  all of you  keep everything I do in your service. Thinking not of power but of possibilities. Not of personal interest but of . public good. . together.r we will write an American story of hope, not fear. Of unity not division, of light, not darkness. A story of decency . dignity, love . healing, greatness . goodness. May this be . story that guides us. . story that inspires us. . . story that tells ages yet to come that we answered . call of history, we met . moment. Democracy . hope, truth . justice, did not die on our watch but thrive. That America secured liberty at home . stood once again as a beacon to . world. That is what we owe our forbearers, one another, . generations to follow.So with purpose . resolve, we turn to those tasks of our time. Sustained by faith, driven by conviction . devoted to one another . . country we love with all our hearts. May God bless America . God protect our troops. Thank you, America.
