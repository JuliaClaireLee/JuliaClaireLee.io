Hello again!


![](https://fsmedia.imgix.net/0b/48/3d/e0/7994/4301/ac18/8616981ab178/spider-man-homecoming-2017.gif?rect=141%2C0%2C860%2C430&auto=format%2Ccompress&w=650&gifq=35){width=650px}

I forgot about this blog/journal! It's been over a year since I wrote a post on this blog. I applied to grad school and got in and graduated college and started grad school^[https://statistics.ucr.edu]. That's crazy to me. Time flies when you are having a 12 month long panic attack! lol!  


I've been listening to the podcast, "Harry Potter and the Sacred Text" and really enjoying it^[https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLmhhcnJ5cG90dGVyc2FjcmVkdGV4dC5jb20vaGFycnlwb3R0ZXJzYWNyZWR0ZXh0&hl=en]. It makes you think deeply about life for a few minutes every week.

I've also been listening to a lot of Bruce Springsteen and I really like his new album, "Western Stars". My favorite song on it is "The Wayfarer."^[https://open.spotify.com/album/6BhqPpIgY83rqoZ2L78Lte?highlight=spotify:track:06OV3qRCboo6THc73Vy2l5]

I've also created a film bucket list. A list of classic and new films I want to see that I haven't seen and films that I know I should see for my own cultural education. There are so many films that are famous that I've never seen but have seen referenced and heard of in other pieces of pop culture. Like I've never seen "Scarface" or "Pulp Fiction" but have seen so much that has referenced them that I know that what it is referencing without having seen it. I've also only seen the first hour of seven samuari (twice) before I fell asleep (twice) and my goal is watch the rest someday. I used to have a chronic problem of falling asleep during movies. There is so much out there that I've not seen and that thrills me.     

   

This blog is like Creed's blog from The Office^[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e5td7-Bpvc].
