Hello again!


![](https://fsmedia.imgix.net/0b/48/3d/e0/7994/4301/ac18/8616981ab178/spider-man-homecoming-2017.gif?rect=141%2C0%2C860%2C430&auto=format%2Ccompress&w=650&gifq=35){width=650px}

I forgot about this blog/journal! It's been over a year since I wrote a post on this blog. I applied to grad school and got in and graduated college and started grad school^[https://statistics.ucr.edu]. That's crazy to me. Time flies when you are having a 12 month long panic attack! lol!  


I've been listening to the podcast, "Harry Potter and the Sacred Text" and really enjoying it^[https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLmhhcnJ5cG90dGVyc2FjcmVkdGV4dC5jb20vaGFycnlwb3R0ZXJzYWNyZWR0ZXh0&hl=en]. It makes you think deeply about life for a few minutes every week.

I've also been listening to a lot of Bruce Springsteen and I really like his new album, "Western Stars". My favorite song on it is "The Wayfarer."^[https://open.spotify.com/album/6BhqPpIgY83rqoZ2L78Lte?highlight=spotify:track:06OV3qRCboo6THc73Vy2l5]

I've also created a film bucket list. A list of classic and new films I want to see that I haven't seen and films that I know I should see for my own cultural education.  

I wish that I had a more educated vocabulary and spoke in a way that was more commanding of the English language. Sadly, I'm a stupid ditzy airhead who is too flippant with her words and who knows nothing. And I can't shut up. I just wish I was as smart as the people around me. but I'm forever dumb. It is a fact of life and I'm okay with that.  

This blog is like Creed's blog from The Office^[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1e5td7-Bpvc].
