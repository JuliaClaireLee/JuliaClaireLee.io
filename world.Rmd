My favorite movie is "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou." I don't know why. I've been listening and reading other people's  thoughts about the film online to somehow figure out the reason why I love it. But I still  can't  reach a good explanation. I could not sell this movie to others because I don't know how to descirbe why it is good. I still don't know why I saw it over 15 times and why it is the only film that I can quote lines from. But I like it so the reason does not really matter.
